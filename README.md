## **Project Description**

#### The Website is composed of two parts:
###### The first part is public and therefore accessible to all. It allows you to browse through movies and to see their information. As a public user you can :

    Access the home page.
    Access the login and signup pages.
    Access all 12 category pages.
    Acces a movie's information.
    Acess the "all movies" pages, in which you can:
        Browse through all movies depending on various filters:
            Title, Producer, Release Date,
            Cast, Upload Date, Uploader

###### The second part is for signed-in users. It allows to administrate movie cards. In addition to a public user's rights, as a signed-in user you can :
    Add a movie.
    Edit a movie's information.
    Delete a movie.

#### Additional Project Information

There is some missing feedbacks for the users, buttons will redirect to other pages without telling user if action worked or not. **Use built-in browser console to get more info while going through the webapp.**

Logging-in and signing-up forms are linked to the back-end server.

A public user will have the same interface as a signed-in user.
If a user tries to acces movie CRUD, the webapp will check if he is signed-in (checking for token in local storage):
If he is not, he will stay on current page.
If he is, he will be redirected to the chosen functionality.

Movie CRUDs have been created in the front-end and back-end but POST methods haven't been established between the server and the webapp. Submit buttons are fake but will still redirect you to the appropriate page once you click.
